The app is a supplementary tool for the Elsen Trading service, http://elsen.co. In order to use the mobile app you need to first activate your account on the website and connect your online brokerage or paper trading account. The mobile app then lets you review your portfolio, view trade opportunities based on your strategy, and see recent trade activity. If you have an active notification, so your strategy says you should buy or sell a company, then you can go into that trade, review the order, make any changes (if you want) and place the order. The order is received to the server submitted to the brokerage and we send a confirmation back the user.

As of now, we do a quick check when the user switched between pages to ensure they have the most up-to-date information, as having outdated data for trading can be really costly. It should be noted that the demo account has hardcoded data on our server. So it is making live calls to the server but when we receive the demo-asd credentials we spit back just some example info. Actual account holders receive more constantly changing data and push notifications, if they opt-in. When the push notification comes through it causes the update on the notifications page, which pulls down the new trade opportunities.
